# Version and release management

Version and release management aims at providing a stable live version for end users and allows you to build and test your app safely.

By default, end users interact with the latest version of your app. After drafting and modifying your ideas, you can preview and compare with different history versions, and finally publish the version that meets all your needs. The newly released version now becomes live, and all your future updates will not affect the live version until you publish again.

## History versions

Openblocks automatically stores all your history changes during the construction of an app, such as addition or deletion of the components, adjustment of the property of the components, rearrangement of the layout, update of a custom function, etc. You can use it to refer to your earlier ideas or revert to a previous version.

## Release management

Apps are usually upgraded on a regular basis to include new features, improve business processes and correct failures. However, the development of a new version of an app takes time and you need to ensure that user experience is not affected during this progress.

By default, end users interact with the latest version of your app. Once you finalize the sketch for a newer version of your app, you can proceed to publish it. Click the **`···` ** at the top-right corner, then click **Publish**.

Now the newly released version becomes live for all end users, and all your future updates will not affect the live version until you publish again.
